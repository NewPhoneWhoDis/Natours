# Natours

Natours is a Web application that allows users to review and book an amazing tours!

## Overview

In this project I am trying to implement more advanced features and concepts, such as:

- Allowing users to reset their password via a link they receive in their email.
- Implementing an aggregation pipeline
- Implementing a booking system using Stripe
- Displaying tour information using Mapbox
- Implementing some common security practises, such as preventing parameter contamination, sanitizing data, implementing rate limits, etc.

The tools that I use in this project are:

- JavaScript
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- HTML
- CSS
- Mapbox
- Nodemailer
- Stripe
- Sendgrind

TODO:
Ideas for upgrades

- Restrict users to only be able to review a tour that they have booked.
- nested booking routes:/tours/:id/bookings & /users/:id/bookings
- advanced authentication: two-factor auth & keep users logged in with refresh tokens
- sign up form
- hide booking section / prevent duplicate bookings on the model
- implement lite tour functionallity with favorites page
- display "My Reviews"
- "Manage" pages for admins
